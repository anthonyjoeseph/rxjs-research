-- CONTENT: the root's record is the meaning's events, as a set.
-- Sortedness (`port.adequacy.Sorted`) says nothing of WHAT arrives; this
-- says nothing of the ORDER, so neither proof reads the other.
--
-- A GHOST: the meaning's own configuration (`denotation.Unfold`'s
-- `Node`), which the machine's configuration runs.  What is still to be
-- delivered is the ghost's residual, its meaning (`U.meaning`); at the
-- launch the ghost is the program subscribed there, so the residual is
-- the meaning's events (`begun`, by `subscribed`).  Each step keeps the
-- residual or delivers a least event of it (`Shows`).  No step of the
-- machine is matched to a step of a stepper.  Only the run's re-entry
-- configurations are related to the ghost (`Strong`); every other is
-- reached from one by its own silent steps.
