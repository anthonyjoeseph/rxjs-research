# PROOF-STATE — the risk ledger

Rules: CLAUDE.md, "PROOF-STATE.md — the risk ledger" and "Two phases".

## Tier −1 — the emission set is compositional

**Compositional:** every former but `defer` means its operator; `defer` unfolds to its body at admissible subscriptions.

### Ledger

## Tier 0 — adequacy

**Adequacy:** what the pure semantics shows is what a reader of the emission set meets, row by row.

### Ledger

## Tier 1 — the instant is a datum

**The instant is a datum:** the subscribe frame, or one async emission (`cascade t e l`), carried in the position; everything green over it.

### Ledger

## Tier 2 — the elaboration

**The elaboration:** `elaborate` makes `make spec-check` green: no seed refutes the batches joined, the grouping by name, or names agreeing with instants.

### Ledger

## Tier 3 — the simultaneous spec

**The spec:** the batched run, each batch stamped by its instant, is the spec's grouping of the plain run, each value stamped by its instant.

### Ledger

#### THE CONSUMPTION

Untried: the elaborated program reads exactly the cold values its plain
program reads, plus its own shallow leaves (a minted name, the subscribed
mark): deep cuts with one plain table have one elaborated table; back
from any table image; placing each image and late row. Every read is
decided by values and cross-stream order (a take's failure, a switch's
next outer value, an exhaust's busy lane, a concat's hand-off), so no
count over one program settles it. Settled when each member is a body
over the per-operator correspondence `tables` asserts.

Members: `stableA`, `img-row`, `img-few`, `put-row`, `causal←`.

#### THE TABLES

Probed: the plain and elaborated tables of one cut correspond along one
position map and one late placement. Switch's list-level simulation
closed with no postulate; exhaust's fuel, pins and the wrappers are
untried. Settled when `tables` is a body over per-operator simulations.

Members: `tables`.

#### THE BATCH RANK

Untried: a batch leaves within its own instant, at the rank its values
carry. Needs the layers' positions to keep instants, and the release
mark to sit in the instant it releases. Settled when `batch-rank` is a
body over the layers and the release protocol.

Members: `batch-rank`.

#### THE RELEASE

Untried: the batcher releases exactly at the protocol's marks — past
the last value with nothing held, a mark past it released it, of one of
four kinds; a held batch is released by marks before the run leaves its
instant. Settled when each is a body over `Walk`'s tally and the
protocol.

Members: `release-at`, `release-on`, `done-end`, `sub-rest`.

#### THE HELD STREAMS

Probed, unproven: every elaborated stream names its begins for their
instants, counts a route of its own instant under every row outside the
bursts it is exempt for, and keeps dead instants dead. Hardest:
flatMap's scan counters, true on every row probed, hand-offs and parks
included: each is the `idle` of what holds the routes, read on the
scan's run split onto that branch (`lane-run`, `lane-next`; a tracker's
split is owed). Then what each branch sent, a reader's joins and the
defer limit. The cold's runs (`cold-covered`) need its rows' order, not
their shape. Settled when each former's leaf is a body.

Members: `outer-current`, `lane-run`, `lane-next`, `lane-idle`,
`lanes-count`, `held-current`, `parked-live`, `live-current`,
`value-open`, `over-open`, `end-open`, `comb-shut`, `walk`,
`step-local`, `outer-sent`, `lane-sent`, `close-sent`, `m-ends`,
`lane-ends`, `close-ends`, `lane-named`, `lane-early`, `lane-late`,
`close-marks`, `scan-idle`, `comb-run`, `held-connected`, `held-lim`,
`held-top`, `held-next`, `held-⊥`, `held-takeWhile`, `cold-rows`,
`cold-covered`, `cold-shut`, `cold-idle`, `held-of`, `held-empty`,
`held-trigger`.

#### THE FINITE REST

Untried: past a zero count only finitely many rows of the instant last
begun remain — a route is held while its instant can still make a row.
Settled when each is a body: connect's rows beyond its body's (bursts,
echoes), the combinator scan's, a cold's.

Members: `cold-rest`, `scan-rest`, `conn-rest`.

#### THE PROTOCOL

Untried: every emit is named for its own instant, one begin and one
value name per instant — the elaboration mints both per async value,
which is per instant; the subscribe mark sits once before every begin
with every value past it async; every value precedes the completion.
Settled when each is a body over the elaboration's layers.

Members: `named`, `one-name`, `one-value-name`, `sub-first`, `sub-one`, `sub-async`, `done-last`.

#### THE PASS

Untried: a run meets on to every visible row up to one with finitely
many rows before it. `listed`, `Reaching.reach` and `run-det` are each
proven; open is the row at the bound itself, which a listing before it
omits. Settled when it is a body over them.

Members: `pass`.
