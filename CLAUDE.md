# Working methodology

This repo pairs an **Agda model** (`agda/`) with a **TypeScript implementation** (`typescript/`).
Agda's spec is gospel; TS conforms to it.

## The Agda impl MUST mirror the TS impl

The Agda **implementation** (`Implementation/`, as opposed to the `Spec/`) exists to model
what the **real rxjs TypeScript** does, operator for operator. It may only use capabilities a
plain rxjs pipeline actually has. A Mealy machine is globally clocked by its input stream, so
it is tempting to lean on per-input boundaries that rxjs does NOT expose downstream — e.g.
grouping *every* synchronous tick's emissions when rxjs's `batchSync` can only bracket the
**subscribe frame** (its `isSync` flag), treating all later emits as individual `async` ones.
Do not do this. If the Agda impl relies on something the TS cannot do, it has diverged and the
correspondence is void. When in doubt about whether a mechanism is portable, **port it to TS
and run the oracle before building on it.**

## Open question: is observable-level provenance sufficient? (report immediately if not)

The impl batches by **observable-level provenance** — a provenance minted once per source
observable, plus a per-provenance subscription count (`cTotal`, the "counting machine") to
recover instant boundaries. The alternative is **per-emission (per-instant) provenance**, which
is exact by construction but costs an id allocation per firing. We are **committed to the
counting machine** for now (it is cheaper, and `Observable` is a hot primitive on the order of
`Promise`/`Array`).

The one finding that would force a change: **definitive proof that observable-level provenance is
fundamentally lossy — that the IMPLEMENTATION contradicts itself, not merely the spec.** This is
NOT the same as "impl disagrees with the spec": the spec is gospel and we are not uncertain about
the desired batching, so a single program where the counting machine gets the wrong answer is
only a *bug we fix by changing the implementation.* The implementation is a pipeline — the
primitives render a run to an emit stream, then `batchSimultaneous` (a pure function of that
stream) recovers the batches. The impossibility proof is **two real programs whose primitives
produce byte-identical emit streams (same provenances, init/close, values, order) but that
genuinely batch differently when run** (ground truth = what real rxjs does, i.e. its synchronous
grouping — independently of the Agda spec). Then a *single* emit stream is demanded to yield two
different batchings, so NO stream-reading implementation — the entire observable-provenance
paradigm — can satisfy both. That is the implementation in contradiction with itself: its own
emit-stream stage collapses two runs that its batching stage must separate, and no change to the
counting rule can recover information the interface already threw away. An attempt to build such
a pair failed once (distinct-value emits are unambiguous; registration counts tend to distinguish
the ambiguous cases), so it is genuinely open. **If you find such a pair, STOP and tell Anthony
immediately; do not act on it — we decide next steps together.**

## The goal: nothing short of a proof

The ultimate and only goal is a **complete machine-checked proof** that the implementation
equals the spec — `Formal-Verification` fully discharged, **no postulates, everything
typechecks**, on *every* canonical program. Partial results, "passes almost all QuickCheck
seeds", "fixes the common case" — none of these are the finish line. They are waypoints.
A remaining counterexample (even 1 in 500, even a pathological nested program) means the
theorem is false and there is no proof. Keep going until it is airtight.

## Autonomy

You have standing approval to make any change that **does not alter the spec** — implementation
edits, protocol changes, new operators, refactors, experiments. Don't stop to ask permission
for these; just go. Finding the right implementation is inherently a throw-a-lot-at-the-wall
process: try approaches, keep what passes QuickCheck/oracle, revert what doesn't, commit the
wins. Only pause to ask when a change would touch the **spec** (`Spec/`, the root README's
semantics), or when the spec is genuinely ambiguous (then follow the ambiguity rule below).

## Agda: work from the outside in

Define and refine the **datatypes, primitives, and end goals first**, then link them
together with **postulates**. Before any serious proof work, all types should be settled
and the top-line results fully stated and typechecking _in terms of postulates_. Only then
start chipping the postulates away, one at a time, until everything is defined and there are
no gaps.

## Keep the repo lean — no fat

This repo always represents the **most present, up-to-date code**. Every definition must be
used somewhere — the only exceptions are the top-level, most-important exports. No
backwards-compatibility shims, nothing "stored for reference", no legacy, no deprecated.
**Do not be afraid to throw out code or documentation.** Git history is the archive.

## TypeScript implementation style

- The TS implementation should be as purely functional as possible: avoid manipulating mutable state and avoid calling .subscribe()
  directly. Delegate any form of IO/statefulness (e.g. accumulation) to rxjs operators like scan.
- Rationale is twofold: (1) aesthetic/cosmetic cleanliness, and (2) to keep the primitives and batchSimultaneous implementations in
  near-direct correspondence with the Agda, so translation between the two is straightforward.

## The change workflow

Follow these phases in order for any change to the implementation or spec:

1. **Agda first.** Make the change to the spec/impl in Agda before touching TypeScript.
2. **QuickCheck dev loop.** Use `npm run agda:qc` (the all-Agda QuickCheck comparing
   `impl-batchSimultaneous` vs `spec-batchSimultaneous`) to align the implementation and
   spec quickly. **The spec is gospel — do NOT touch it to resolve a mismatch.** When impl
   and spec disagree, the implementation is wrong by default; change the implementation.
   Only touch the spec under very special circumstances, and only after asking.

   **Resolving ambiguity.** When the spec seems ambiguous or you're unsure what the "right"
   answer is, defer to **naive plain rxjs** — the semantics should mirror ordinary rxjs
   wherever a case is underspecified. Actually run the example in rxjs and see. If that
   still doesn't resolve it, surface the question to the user with a clear TypeScript rxjs
   example that **avoids the `*All()` higher-order operators where possible** and follows
   the style of the README's edge-case examples.

3. **Ignore `Formal-Verification/` for now.** It may have errors during this phase — that's
   fine. Leave it until the end.
4. **Port to TypeScript** — but only once QuickCheck passes.
5. **Oracle.** Make the fast-check/Agda-alignment oracle (`npm run oracle`, TS-impl vs
   Agda-impl via the CLI) pass.
6. **Formal verification, last.** Now prove the implementation equals the spec. Do it in
   **phases** — leave middle steps as postulates and **commit in-between results**. Work
   until there are **no gaps**: no postulates, everything typechecks.

## Bug cache: type-level unit tests

When you discover an implementation bug, capture it immediately as a **type-level unit test**
in `agda/src/Implementation/Unit-Test.agda` — a `_ : impl prog ≡ expected` that Agda checks
by `refl` at compile time. These are a **performance cache** of discovered work: faster to
recheck than QuickCheck, faster at the type level than at runtime. They pin down the exact
value the impl must produce for a specific canonical program (spec-derived), so a regression
fails the typechecker instantly instead of surfacing only in a random seed.

Keep them dead simple — no fancy names, no abstraction, just a wall of little `_ : … ≡ …`
entries. They exist only to accelerate finding the implementation; they are **not** meant to
survive past the proof. Delete the module once `Formal-Verification` is discharged.

The cache is **append-only**: `scripts/gen-unit-tests.sh [FIRST] [LAST]` appends each new
counterexample (deduped by program text) and never deletes or overwrites. A fixed bug just
becomes a passing guard that stays forever. Invariant: **`Unit-Test.agda` fully typechecks ⟺
no known counterexample remains** — green there is the impl≡spec finish line. `QuickCheck`
reads `SEED [DEPTH] [RUNS] [DRY]` on stdin: DEPTH caps program nesting (a hard size cap);
DRY≥1 prints one generated case without evaluating (DRY≥2 forces/​times its eval) — for
isolating pathological cases.

In some cases, however, it might make sense to adding a new "naive rx" operator to fix an Agda-impl bug.

This is allowed and encouraged when it's the best solution. But follow the port order:

- Develop the new operator in TypeScript first (as a proper rxjs-delegating, purely-functional operator).
