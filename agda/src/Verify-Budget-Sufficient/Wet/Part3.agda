-- STRATUM 2b of Verify-Budget-Sufficient: THE WET FAMILY, part 3 of 4.
--
-- `cascadeGo-walk`, and nothing else: the W11-A/B width and Ω
-- preservation lemmas that made up the rest of this module went with the
-- width walk (.Measures carries the record).  What remains consumes the
-- wet block above as finished facts.
--
-- Split from Verify-Budget-Sufficient.Wet so that a
-- multi-member block gets its own module and an edit re-checks one
-- part instead of 4.7k lines.  The family is FOUR modules numbered
-- 1, 2, 3, 6: Parts 4 and 5 were the width walk and went with it
-- .  The gap is deliberate — renaming Part6 would churn
-- every consumer's import for nothing, and .Measures carries the
-- deletion record.

-- the three cores
------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE PROOF DESIGN for the three cores (after the tower
-- attack).  The wet contract for the mutual subscription block is one
-- strengthened induction, consumed through `hasAtLeast`:
--
--   fuel hasAtLeast need(args) → no dry × stores land bounded
--
-- and the induction that defines/bounds `need` is LEXICOGRAPHIC over
-- the three decrement edges:

--   1. share connect — decreases the UNCONNECTED-SLOT COUNT
--      (connectedShares latches; a def's walk can only shrink it).

--   2. μ-unfold — decreases SYNC-REACHABLE SIZE (syncSizeᵉ, deferᵉ
--      a leaf): unfoldμ substitutes `μᵉ body` only at var positions,
--      and vars are TYPE-GUARANTEED defer-gated (Δᵍ→Δ moves only at
--      deferᵉ), so the substituted copies are invisible to the
--      synchronous walk.  DISCHARGED above: syncSize-unfoldμ /
--      unfoldμ-shrinks, machine-checked.

--   3. subscribeInner — decreases the DERSHOWITZ–MANNA MULTISET of
--      SHELL sizes (the SHELL DESIGN, adopted with
--      Anthony's approval, replacing the layer-derivation reading).
--      A runtime obs value IS a closed expression; its measure is
--      measureE = counts B ∘ shellsᵉ — the multiset of operator-
--      skeleton sizes of the value and every sync-reachable
--      embedded observable (Rx.Exp.shellsᵉ), a pure function of
--      syntax.  Shells count Exp constructors ONLY (Tm material
--      weightless, strmᵗ/deferᵉ leaves), which buys the design's
--      two load-bearing facts, both PROVEN above:

--        · substitution invariance (shellSize-subΘ): subΘ rewrites
--          only Tm material, so instantiation preserves every
--          shell size EXACTLY.  No inflation — an instantiated
--          template's multiset is a class-preserved copy of the
--          template's plus the plugged obs values' own shells
--          (reify-inner: a plug's footprint is void, its shells
--          join the inner multiset verbatim).

--        · free side conditions: every shell of e is ≤ sizeᵉ e
--          (shells-≤/shellsᵛ-≤) and shells number ≤ sizeᵉ e
--          (shells-len) — so stBounded?'s sizeᵛ cap bounds both
--          the classes (≤ B) and the entry sum (≤ V, the rank
--          bridge's side condition).  NO new invariant; the whole
--          Layered derivation apparatus is deleted (git: 1fbc59c).
--      The hops:

--        · embedded-value hop (subscribing a value that sits as a
--          strmᵗ subtree of the carrier — of-list literals under
--          closed evaluation, evalWith (strmᵗ e) []ᵃ = e): its
--          shellsᵉ is a CONTIGUOUS sublist of the carrier's inner
--          (innerᵗ (strmᵗ e) = shellsᵉ e), and the carrier's own
--          shell rides on top — strict sub-multiset, ≺-embed.

--        · eval/scan-produced hop (applyFn/evalWith instantiates a
--          template): by shellSize-subΘ the produced multiset =
--          the fn-body strmᵗ subtree's sub-multiset, classes on
--          the nose, ⊎ the plugged obs values' shells.  The first
--          part is the embed shape again; the plugged part is
--          where the LEDGER lives — the plugs are prior stored
--          values whose shells the global multiset already owns
--          (deliveries ≤ syntactic occurrences because subΘ
--          COPIES trees — SYNC-LINEARITY, PROVEN above:
--          plugs-lenᵉ bounds the plug cardinality by occsᵉ · V,
--          occs≤syncᵉ caps occurrences syntactically, and
--          inner-len-subΘ is the exact length bookkeeping).  The
--          multiset-level input is the subΘ multiset equation
--          (subΘ-countsᵉ, proven); subΘ-capᵉ is its All-cap
--          shadow and subΘ-shells-len its entry-sum package.

--        · share-crossing hop (a template's `input` hits a slot):
--          exits the per-value measure — it anchors against the
--          slot's own element of the GLOBAL multiset {program} ⊎
--          {slots}; that re-anchoring is the ownership half of the
--          ledger (the cascade fold-threading memo), not the per-value order.
--      (The layer-derivation design worked but carried an
--      an unfixable wart: unused env entries gave layers with no
--      syntactic footprint, so the entry-sum side condition needed
--      its own invariant.  The design before THAT — lex (skeleton,
--      value size), subterm-ordered — is REFUTED: chain two
--      obs-typed scans directly, second fn λ(b,v). mergeAll(of[snd
--      x]), and the embedded-value hop lands on a first-scan ac
--      whose template is subterm-incomparable with the carrier's
--      and can dwarf it.)

-- THE DEMAND, closed-form and PROVEN (dBound above).  Fuel is
-- depth-consumed, so the contract carries
--
--   fuel hasAtLeast suc (dBound V R U r s)
--
-- with V the store size bound, R = (suc V)^(suc B) the store rank
-- cap (rank-lt-pow), U = unconn, r = the current value's rank, s =
-- the current expression's syncSize.  Each decrement edge consumes
-- one gs against a strictly smaller demand: dBound-μ
-- (unfoldμ-shrinks drops s), dBound-hop (rank-mono-≺ over
-- ≺-embed/≺-replace drops r, s resets ≤ V), dBound-connect
-- (unconn-insert drops U, r resets ≤ R) — all three proven, so the
-- clause proofs only apply them.  dBound < (suc V)^(B+3)·suc U:
-- one exponential story above the store bound, while the seeded
-- budget's tower gains (suc sz) stories per instant —
-- budget-hasAtLeast's tower summand dominates with room to spare,
-- and every literal-headed demand (no chained scans) is already
-- covered by the 2^(sz·(id+1)²) summand alone.

-- The cores below are the contract instantiated at
-- the root burst (burst-dry/-bounded) and at the chain fold
-- (the cascade fold-threading memo); the disjointness argument (each registration's
-- path owns its minted nodes, so per-cascade store traffic is
-- structure-bounded) supplies the store-boundedness half.

-- THE WALK INVARIANT (the clause-grind session).  The
-- stated subscribeE-wet is the contract's OUTER FACE only — its
-- `sizeᵉ b ≤ V` hypothesis holds at both instantiation sites (root
-- program; stored values) but does NOT self-apply down the walk,
-- and the induction must generalize internally:
--   · μ edge: unfoldμ COPIES the closed μ, so sizeᵉ grows past any
--     fixed cap along iterated unfolds.  Thread the SHELL caps
--     instead — every shell preserved-or-stepped-down and the
--     count exactly preserved (shells-unfoldμ-cap/-len above);
--     sizeᵉ is only needed for STORABILITY, against the (tower)
--     landing budget, not against V.
--   · no fixed (V, R) survives the walk: a scan frame folds each
--     value with NO fuel peel (fuel is depth-consumed; breadth is
--     free), and each fold is one base swap (applyFn-size), so
--     mid-walk stores legitimately outgrow the entry cap V and
--     later inner subscriptions carry ranks past R.  A cap indexed
--     by REMAINING GAS fails for the same reason (folds do not
--     peel gas).
--   · the missing accounting is a per-instant BREADTH LEDGER: the
--     value-list lengths threading stepFrame/pushBurst.  SETTLED
--     — see THE WALK LEDGER section above: the sharp
--     eval bound (caseW, substitution-invariant exponent) replaces
--     applyFn-size's self-inflating one, the ledger is the
--     multiplicative exponent capᴱ W₀ E with one uniform ×3^(suc Ψ)
--     rule per eval edge and ×2 per cheap edge, fold-runs cost
--     3^(suc Ψ · m) by scanVals-sharp, and INV? (store bounds +
--     fn caps + registry cardinality + chain frames) is the
--     invariant the walk contracts thread.  The count cap's DESIGN
--     is closed (memo (5), THE WIDTH LEDGER, corrected to
--     the recurrence-closed walkCap form): widths are
--     substitution-invariant, so run lengths and the per-lineage
--     fold count 𝔉 anchor at walkCap — all entry-frozen.  The
--     JOINT FACE (subscribeE-walk above) states wet + dry + ledger
--     together; what remains is its clause grind and the landing
--     composition; until THAT lands, the landing halves live in
--     these two cores and nowhere else.
